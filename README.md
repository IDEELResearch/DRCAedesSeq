The code in this project accompanies an effort to investigate the virome in Aedes mosquitoes from Kimpese, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). 
The DRC is the largest country in central Africa with a population of over 100 million, and a tropical climate conducive to mosquito survival. Considerable attention is devoted to the high burden of malaria in the DRC, but arboviruses remain neglected, with limited studies of humans and mosquitoes to-date. 
To improve our understanding of the role of Aedes mosquito vectors in arboviral transmission in the DRC, we collected and sequenced the virome of mosquito pools from three areas of Kimpese, a region near the Angola border which has experienced recent arboviral outbreaks.
