The code in this project accompanies an effort to investigate the virome of wild-caught Aedes mosquitoes from Kimpese, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The DRC is the second largest country in Africa and has an estimated population of over 100 million. Its tropical climate is conducive to mosquito survival. Considerable attention is devoted to the high burden of malaria in the DRC, but arboviruses remain neglected, with limited studies of humans and mosquitoes to-date. To improve our understanding of the role of Aedes mosquito vectors in arboviral transmission in the DRC, we collected and sequenced the virome of mosquito pools from three areas of Kimpese, a region near the Angola border which has experienced recent arboviral outbreaks.
